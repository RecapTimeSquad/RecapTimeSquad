# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the placeholder/administrative account for [Recap Time Squad](https://github.com/recaptime-dev) and other GitHub orgs we manage. You can use this placeholder to mention us in issues
or in pull requests, and a team member will respond as soon as possible, though our humans have other business outside GitHub/GitLab SaaS.

## Team Members and contact details

Check [our organization README](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/.github/blob/HEAD/profile/README.md) or [our website](https://recaptime.eu.org).

## Other accounts managed by squad

* [@recaptimedev-automation[bot]](https://github.com/apps/recaptimedev-automation) - GitHub app version of our main machine account as API rate-limit workaround
