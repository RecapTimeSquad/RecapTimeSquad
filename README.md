# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the placeholder account for [Recap Time Squad](https://github.com/RecapTime) and other GitHub orgs we manage. You can use this placeholder to mention us in issues
or in pull requests, and a team member will respond as soon as possible, though our humans have other business outside GitHub/GitLab SaaS.

## Team Members and contact details

Check our org README or on <https://wiki.recaptime.eu.org/wiki/Handbook:Squad_members> for the full list.
